## Fitting the W-jet mass peak

After having produced your input samples, you can now move to the fitting part. There are two methods: fitting the W-subjet mass peak 
where the W is the highest-mass subjet of an AK8 (fully merged) or fitting the W-jet mass peak where the W-jet is the Ak8 jet (partially merged).
To run both as well sa do statistical combination, simply do

```
sh fitAll.sh

```

If you need to tweak the fits or simply wish to run only one, see the README of each Fitter directory (partiallyMerged of fullyMerged).
